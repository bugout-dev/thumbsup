## Running the server

### Directly

```

To run the development server:
```
FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=thumbsup.server flask run
```

```
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 thumbsup.server:app
```

```

To run a container:

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 simiotics/thumbsup
```

### Accessing in browser

Once you have a server set up, Thumbsup should be available at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## GitHub rate limit

Thumbsup uses the GitHub API to retrieve issue comments. If you do not provide a GitHub access
token, Thumbsup is subject to the unauthenticated GitHub API rate limit of 60 calls per hour.

You can provide a [GitHub access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
by setting it as the value for the `THUMBSUP_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. This will bring
your available rate limit to 5000 requests per hour (higher if you have a better GitHub plan).

You can also set a minimum rate limit threshold below which Thumbsup will fail all requests. To do
this, set the `THUMBSUP_RATE_LIMIT_BOUND` to an integer value.

To pass these environment variables to Thumbsup through docker, assuming they are set in your shell:

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 \
    -e THUMBSUP_GITHUB_TOKEN="$THUMBSUP_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    -e THUMBSUP_RATE_LIMIT_BOUND="$THUMBSUP_RATE_LIMIT_BOUND" \
    simiotics/thumbsup
```

See [sample.env](./sample.env) for an example of how to set these environment variables. To use it
locally:

1. Run `$ cp sample.env my.env`

2. Update the values in `my.env`.

3. Source the file: `$ . my.env`.

## Stack Exchange API authentication

To generate an access token for the Stack Exchange API, follow their [authentication guide](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/authentication).
